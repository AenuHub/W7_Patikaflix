In this practice we are aiming to create a list of Arrays and define the objects in it. The creation of the elements 
will be through the Console screen.

We need to ask the user if they have added a new array after creating each array and adding it to the list.

Perform the operations requested below.

- Create a new list from the comedy series in your first list. This list should contain only Series Name / Series Type 
/ Director information

- Print all the elements of this new list to the screen with all their properties. Make sure that the writing is sorted 
first by series names and then by director names.
